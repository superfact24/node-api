# Node.js API

A simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. This project demonstrates the creation of a basic API with endpoints for CRUD operations, authentication, and error handling.

## üì± Features

- RESTful API design
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality
- JWT-based authentication
- Middleware for validation and error handling
- Environment-based configuration
- Support for MongoDB or any other database

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X.X.X or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or any other database you prefer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/superfact24/node-api.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd node-api
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your environment variables. Example:
    ```bash
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

5. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Tests

To run the tests for this API:
```bash
npm test
